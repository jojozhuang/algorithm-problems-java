/**
 * 509. Fibonacci Number
 * The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
 * <p>
 * F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
 * F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
 * Given N, calculate F(N).
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
