/**
 * 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team
 *
 * There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n and two arrays: speed and efficiency, where speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency for the i-th engineer respectively. Return the maximum performance of a team composed of at most k engineers, since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
 * Output: 60
 * Explanation:
 * We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3
 * Output: 68
 * Explanation:
 * This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4
 * Output: 72
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * speed.length == n
 * efficiency.length == n
 * 1 <= speed[i] <= 10^5
 * 1 <= efficiency[i] <= 10^8
 * 1 <= k <= n
