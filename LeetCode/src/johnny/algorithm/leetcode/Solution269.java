/**
 * Alien Dictionary.
 * There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the 
 * order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of words from the 
 * dictionary, wherewords are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this 
 * new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given the following words in dictionary,
 * 
 * [
 *   "wrt",
 *   "wrf",
 *   "er",
 *   "ett",
 *   "rftt"
 * ]
 * The correct order is: "wertf".
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
 * If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
 * There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.
