/**
 * 932. Beautiful Array

For some fixed N, an array A is beautiful if it is a permutation of the integers 1, 2, ..., N, such that:

For every i < j, there is no k with i < k < j such that A[k] * 2 = A[i] + A[j].

Given N, return any beautiful array A.  (It is guaranteed that one exists.)

 

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: [2,1,4,3]
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: [3,1,2,5,4]
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 1000
