/**
 * Solve the Equation
 * 
 * Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string 
 * "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable x 
 * and its coefficient.
 * 
 * If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution".
 * If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions".
 * If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of x is an integer.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
 * Output: "x=2"
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: "x=x"
 * Output: "Infinite solutions"
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: "2x=x"
 * Output: "x=0"
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * Input: "2x+3x-6x=x+2"
 * Output: "x=-1"
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * Input: "x=x+2"
 * Output: "No solution"
