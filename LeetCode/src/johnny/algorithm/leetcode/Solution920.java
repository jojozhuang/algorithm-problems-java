/**
 * 920. Number of Music Playlists

Your music player contains N different songs and she wants to listen to L (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that:

Every song is played at least once
A song can only be played again only if K other songs have been played
Return the number of possible playlists.  As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, L = 3, K = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].
Example 2:

Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]
Example 3:

Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists. [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2]
 

Note:

0 <= K < N <= L <= 100
