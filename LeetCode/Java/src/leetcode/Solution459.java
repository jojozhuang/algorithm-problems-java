/**
 * Repeated Substring Pattern
 * 
 * Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring
 * of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume
 * the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length 
 * will not exceed 10000.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "abab"
 * 
 * Output: True
 * 
 * Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: "aba"
 * 
 * Output: False
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: "abcabcabcabc"
 * 
 * Output: True
 * 
 * Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring 
 * "abcabc" twice.)
