/**
 * Distinct Subsequences.
 * Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences 
 * of T in S.
 * 
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original 
 * string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing 
 * the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a 
 * subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
 * 
 * Here is an example:
 * S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
 * 
 * Return 3.
