/**
 * Out of Boundary Paths
 * 
 * There is an m by n grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate (i,j) of the 
 * ball, you can move the ball to adjacent cell or cross the grid boundary in 
 * four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can at most move N 
 * times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. 
 * The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input:m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input:m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1
 * Output: 12
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * Note:
 * 1. Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.
 * 2. The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].
 * 3. N is in range [0,50].
