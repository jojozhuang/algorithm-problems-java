/**
 * Battleships in a Board
 * 
 * Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are 
 * represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume 
 * the following rules:
 * 
 * You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
 * Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, 
 * they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or 
 * Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
 * 
 * At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - 
 * there are no adjacent battleships.
 * 
 * Example:
 * X..X
 * ...X
 * ...X
 * 
 * In the above board there are 2 battleships.
 * 
 * Invalid Example:
 * ...X
 * XXXX
 * ...X
 * 
 * This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will 
 * always have a cell separating between them.
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * Could you do it in one-pass, using only O(1) extra memory and without 
 * modifying the value of the board?
