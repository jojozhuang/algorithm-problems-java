/**
 * Shortest Distance from All Buildings.
 * You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in 
 * the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. 
 * You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:
 * 
 * Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
 * Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
 * Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
 * 
 * For example, given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle 
 * at (0,2). The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the 
 * total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
